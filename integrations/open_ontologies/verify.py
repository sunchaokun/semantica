"""Verification of Semantica's RDF exports.

Three checks a generation pipeline cannot run on itself, in the order that a
failure in one makes the next meaningless:

1. **Syntax, strictly.** Whether the output is RDF 1.1 at all. rdflib is lenient
   by design and will resolve a relative reference like ``<Acme Corp>`` against
   the file location, producing a ``file://`` IRI and a warning rather than an
   error, so a graph can "load" and still be nothing like what was meant.
   Oxigraph refuses it, which is the answer you want before publishing.

2. **Vocabulary, closed-world.** Whether the terms used were declared. RDF is
   open-world, so an invented predicate is unknown rather than wrong and passes
   both parsing and SHACL untouched. Closing the world against a declared
   vocabulary is the only way to separate a real term from a plausible one, and
   it is exactly the check an extraction pipeline needs, because inventing
   plausible terms is what extractors do when they are unsure.

3. **Shapes, with an audit of what was examined.** Whether constraints held, and
   how many nodes they held over. A shapes graph whose targets are absent from
   the data reports conformance having checked nothing, and that report is
   indistinguishable from a real pass. Every verdict here carries the focus-node
   count behind it.

Runs on ``open-ontologies-lite``, a pure-Python package over the Oxigraph engine.
No Rust toolchain, no service to run, no network.
